                <p>This colt is simply an icon of all weapons, today its construction has been around for over 100 years, and it is still manufactured today, there have been a few design changes, but it is basically the same thing. Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols. It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA, IDPA, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and bullseye shooting. Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons in the U.S. because of the design's relatively slim width and the stopping power of the .45 ACP cartridge.</p>

                <p>The original PP was released in 1929. It was designed for police use and was used by police forces in Europe in the 1930s and later. The semi-automatic pistol operated using a simple blowback action. The PP was designed with several safety features, some of them innovative, including an automatic hammer block, a combination safety/decocker and a loaded chamber indicator.

                    All members of the PP series share a common takedown procedure. The trigger guard is hinged; by pulling the trigger guard downwards, the slide can be drawn backwards past the normal stopping point, lifted clear of the slide rail, and then guided back forward to clear the barrel. With the slide removed the blowback spring around the barrel is free and can be removed as well.</p>

                <p>The pistol that is now generally, but
                    misleadingly, known as the Luger had
                    its design origins in a pistol design first
                    produced in 1893 by one Hugo Borchardt. A George Luger further developed this design and produced the
                    weapon that bears his name to this day.
                    The first Lugers were manufactured in
                    7.65-mm (0.301-in) calibre and were
                    adopted by the Swiss army in 1900,
                    Thereafter the basic design was
                    adopted by many nations and the type
                    is still to be encountered, for by now
                    well over two million have been produced by various manufacturers and at
                    least 35 main variants are known to
                    exist, together with a host of subvariants.
                    The Pistole P 08 was one of the main
                    variants. It was taken into German
                    army service in 1908 (hence the 08)
                    and remained the standard German
                    service pistol until the  <a class="ahojky" href="#ahoj"> Walther P 38 </a>
                     was introduced in 1938.</p>

                <p>The Walther P 38 was developed primarily to replace the P 08, which was
                    an excellent weapon but expensive to produce. After the National Socialists
                    came to power in Germany in 1933
                    they decided upon a deliberate pro- gramme of military expansion into which the old P 08 could not fit. What
                    was wanted was a pistol that could be
                    quickly and easily produced but one that embodied all the many and va- rious design features such as a handcocked trigger and improved safeties
                    that were then becoming more com- mon. Walther eventually received the
                    contract for this new pistol in 1938, but
                    only after a long programme of de- velopment.</p>

                <p>The 7.92-mm (0.312-in) Gewehr 98 was
                    the rifle with which the German army
                    fought through World War I. It was a
                    Mauser rifle first produced in 1898, but
                    was based on a design dating back to
                    1888. In service the Mauser action
                    proved sturdy and reliable, but in the
                    years following 1918 the German army
                    carried out a great deal of operational
                    analysis that demonstrated that the
                    Gewehr 98 was really too long and
                    bulky for front-line use, As an immediate result the surviving Gewehr 98s
                    underwent a modification programme
                    that changed their designation to Karabiner 98b. Karabiner is the German for
                    carbine, but there was nothing of the
                    carbine in the Karabiner 98b, whose
                    length was unchanged from that of the
                    original Gewehr 98. The only changes
                    were to the bolt handle, the sling
                    swivels and the ability to use improved
                    ammunition. To confuse matters further the original Gewehr 98 markings
                    were retained.
                    The Karabiner 98b was still in service with the German army in 1939
                    (and remained so throughout the war),
                    but by then the standard rifle was a
                    slightly shorter version of the basic
                    Mauser known as the Karabiner 98k.
                    This was slightly shorter than the original Gewehr 98 but was still long for a
                    carbine, despite the letter suffix 'k'
                    standing for kurz, or short. This rifle
                    was based on a commercial Mauser
                    model known as the Standard and
                    widely produced throughout the interwar years in countries such as
                    Czechoslovakia, Belgium and even China. The German version was
                    placed in production in 1935 and
                    thereafter made in very large num- bers. At first the standard of production
                    was excellent, but once World War II
                    had started the overall finish and standards fell to the extent that by the end
                    of the war the wooden furniture was
                    often laminated or of an inferior material, and such items as bayonet lugs
                    were omitted. All manner of extras
                    were evolved by the gadget-minded
                    Germans for the Karabiner 98k, including grenade-launching devices, periscopic sights and folding butts for
                    weapons used by airborne troops.
                    There were also variations for sniper
                    use, some with small telescopic sights
                    mounted half way along the forestock
                    and others with larger telescopes
                    mounted over the bolt action.</p>

                <p>Germany's quest for a semi-automatic infantry rifle resulted in two designs – the G41(M) and G41(W), from Mauser and Walther Arms respectively. The Mauser design was introduced in 1941 and at least 12,755 were made, but it proved unreliable in combat. The Walther design fared better in combat but still suffered from reliability problems. The problems with both designs stemmed from a demand made by the Army that the rifles not use holes drilled into the barrel, known as ports, to run the automatic loading mechanism. Meeting this requirement meant the designs had to use uncommon mechanisms that were simply unreliable and highly prone to fouling.

                    The German invasion of the Soviet Union led to small numbers of the SVT-40 being captured and returned to Germany for examination. These used a simple gas mechanism powered from a port cut into the barrel about 1/3 of the way back from the end, and replaced the conventional stripper reloads with a modern box magazine. It was clearly superior to the G41's, and simpler as well. In 1943, Walther combined a similar gas system with aspects of the G41(W) providing greatly improved performance. It was accepted and entered into service as the Gewehr 43, renamed Karabiner 43 in April 1944, with production amounting to just over 400,000 between 1943 and 1945.</p>

                <p>The pistol that is now generally, but
                    misleadingly, known as the Luger had
                    its design origins in a pistol design first
                    produced in 1893 by one Hugo Borchardt. A George Luger further developed this design and produced the
                    weapon that bears his name to this day.
                    The first Lugers were manufactured in
                    7.65-mm (0.301-in) calibre and were
                    adopted by the Swiss army in 1900,
                    Thereafter the basic design was
                    adopted by many nations and the type
                    is still to be encountered, for by now
                    well over two million have been produced by various manufacturers and at
                    least 35 main variants are known to
                    exist, together with a host of subvariants.
                    The Pistole P 08 was one of the main
                    variants. It was taken into German
                    army service in 1908 (hence the 08)
                    and remained the standard German
                    service pistol until the  <a class="ahojky" href="#ahoj"> Walther P 38 </a>
                     was introduced in 1938.</p>

                <p>The Walther P 38 was developed primarily to replace the P 08, which was
                    an excellent weapon but expensive to produce. After the National Socialists
                    came to power in Germany in 1933
                    they decided upon a deliberate pro- gramme of military expansion into which the old P 08 could not fit. What
                    was wanted was a pistol that could be
                    quickly and easily produced but one that embodied all the many and va- rious design features such as a handcocked trigger and improved safeties
                    that were then becoming more com- mon. Walther eventually received the
                    contract for this new pistol in 1938, but
                    only after a long programme of de- velopment.</p>
